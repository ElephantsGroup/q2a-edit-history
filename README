NOTE: THIS PLUGIN IS NOT FINISHED, it's a work in progress. It currently stores edits but does nothing with them.



-------------------------------------------------
EDIT HISTORY v0.1
Question2Answer plugin
-------------------------------------------------

This is an event plugin for popular open source Q&A platform, Question2Answer <question2answer.org>. It stores all edits to posts, allowing users to see what was changed, and allows moderators to roll back revisions if required.




INSTALLATION & USAGE
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the files to a subfolder such as `edit-history` inside the `qa-plugins` folder of your Q2A installation.

2. Go to Admin > Plugins and click the 'Set up edit history' button.

3. I recommend blocking search engine access to the post revisions, since it could count as duplicate content. Simply add the following two lines to your robots.txt file (where `qa` is your Q2A subfolder if applicable):

User-agent: *
Disallow: /qa/revisions/
